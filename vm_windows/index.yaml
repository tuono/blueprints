variables:
  admin_username:
    description: >-
      The administrative account username to use for RDP access.  Note this only
      works on Azure; on AWS this variable is ignored and `Administrator` is used.
      This is an issue we are aware of and plan to resolve.

    default: adminuser
  admin_password:
    description: >-
      The administrative account password to use for RDP access.  Note this only
      works on Azure; on AWS this variable is ignored, as the EC2Launch service
      generates a random password that you must acquire through the AWS console.
      This is an issue we are aware of and plan to resolve.

  admin_public_key:
    description: >-
      The OpenSSH Public Key used to protect access to the randomly generated
      Administrative password on AWS.  This is ignored on Azure.
